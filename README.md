# CursorIntegrator
 An OpenTabletDriver Plugin

I couldn't figure out how to make a plugin from scratch so I used [AbstractOTDPlugins](https://github.com/AbstractQbit/AbstractOTDPlugins) as a base, that means that in order to build the plugin you need to download AbstractOTDPlugins and add a folder containing CursorIntegrator, then you need to edit AbstractOTDPlugins.sln to include the files.
